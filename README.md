These are my local dotfiles for configuring an OSX machine to my personal
preferences. They are meant to supplement or override the excellent settings
found in the [Hashrocket Dotmatrix](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix).

### Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jwworth/dotfiles.git
```

Next, create a symlink for each file from the root directory:

```
$ ln -s  ~/path/to/dotfiles/.example.local ~/
```

Each file represents a symlink to a file in the root directory.
