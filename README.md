These are my local dotfiles for configuring an OSX machine to my personal
preferences. They supplement the excellent settings found in the [Hashrocket
Dotmatrix](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix).

### Installation

```
$ mkdir ~/oss
$ cd ~/oss
$ git clone https://github.com/jwworth/dotfiles.git
```

Next, run the setup script:

```
$ bin/setup
```

To set up a new Mac, run:

```
$ ./.macos
```
