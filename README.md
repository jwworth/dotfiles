These are my local dotfiles for configuring an OSX machine to my personal
preferences. They supplement the excellent settings found in the [Hashrocket
Dotmatrix](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix).

### Installation

```
$ cd <code_directory>
$ git clone https://github.com/jwworth/dotfiles.git
```

Next, create a symlink for each file from the root directory:

```
$ ln -s  ~/<code_directory>/dotfiles/.<some_dotfile>.local ~/
```
